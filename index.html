            <p class="paragraph" style="color: blue;">
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the core language used to create web pages. It defines the structure
                of
                a webpage by organizing content and elements into a readable format for web browsers. HTML is used to
                specify the placement and display of text, images, videos, links, forms, and other multimedia elements
                on a
                webpage.</p>

            <p>
                Each HTML document begins with a declaration that specifies the document type and version. It is then
                divided into two main sections: the head and the body. The head section contains metadata about the
                document, such as the page title, character encoding, and links to external resources like stylesheets
                or
                scripts. The body section holds the actual content that appears on the page, like text, images, and
                interactive elements.
            </p>

            <p>
                HTML is not a programming language; it's a markup language used to structure content. It works in tandem
                with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. CSS is used to control the visual presentation, such
                as
                colors, fonts, and layout, while JavaScript adds dynamic functionality, like animations and interactive
                features.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the introduction of HTML5, the language has become more advanced. It introduced new semantic
                elements
                that make it easier to structure and organize content logically. These elements improve the
                accessibility
                and readability of web pages, especially for search engines and screen readers. For example, HTML5
                includes
                elements like article, section, header, footer, and navigation, which make it easier to understand the
                purpose of different parts of a page.
            </p>

            <p>
                HTML also supports multimedia elements, allowing developers to embed audio and video directly into web
                pages
                without needing external plugins. Forms are another essential feature of HTML, enabling users to submit
                data
                to websites for tasks like registration, login, and feedback.

            </p>
            <p>
                Hyperlinks are an essential feature of HTML, allowing users to navigate between different pages and
                websites. They are used to create connections to other resources and pages, and they form the backbone
                of
                web navigation.
            </p>

            <p>The flexibility and simplicity of HTML make it an essential skill for anyone interested in web
                development.
                Whether you're creating a simple webpage or building a complex web application, HTML provides the
                foundational structure for all online content. Over time, HTML has evolved to meet new technological
                needs,
                and its role in web development continues to grow.
